    You'll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.
    You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
  </p>

  <p>
    To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
  </p>

  <p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

  <pre>
    <code class="language-python">
def print_hi(name):
    print("hello", name)

print_hi('Tom')
    </code>
  </pre>
